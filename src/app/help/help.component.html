            In most submission forms, only some of the fields may be required, such as the study's title or
            its release date. For ease of reference, all required fields are listed under the <i>Validation</i>
            tab on the left-hand side of the form at all times. Clicking on any entry of the validation list
            sets the focus on the relevant field, scrolling directly to it if needed.

          <p><img class="help-img" src="images/help/check_tab.png" alt="Submission validation example" /></p>
          <p>Some optional groups of fields include mandatory fields, but the entire group can be deleted if not
            relevant. In the example below, "Annotations" are "Optional" but can be deleted by pressing
            <button type="button" class="btn btn-sm btn-link text-danger" tooltip="Delete section">
              <i class="fas fa-trash"></i> Delete.

            . Dropdowns inputs in the edit submission form allow to enter new items. This applies to Organism,
            Organisation and any other dropdown.

          <ul>
            <li>Look for your item, if it doesn't show up in the list an "Add item" option should come up</li>

            A given study can be edited at any point of its lifecycle. Editing a submitted study will create a new
            <i>"Draft"</i>. Any recent changes in this draft can be cancelled, reverting the form to its previous state
            before the changes. New fields may be added through the <i>"Add"</i> tab on the left-hand side of the form.
            It includes the most common field types for a study such as publication tables or annotations lists.
            In the app, tables and lists are generally referred to as <i>"grids"</i>.
          </p>
          <p><img class="help-img" src="images/help/add_tab.png" alt="Add new elements to submission form example" />
          </p>
          If a grid is already present in the form, a new row will be added when clicking on the
          corresponding entry in the <i>"Add"</i> tab.
          <button type="button" class="btn-add btn btn-link">
            <i class="fa fa-sm fa-plus-circle"></i>
            Add &lt;Section&gt; row
          </button>
          button inside the corresponding grid has the same effect.
          Pre-defined or custom table columns may be added too through the
          <button type="button" class="btn-add btn btn-link">
            <i class="fa fa-sm fa-plus-circle"></i>
            Column
          </button>
          button. For more advanced field operations, two options are provided:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong><i class="fas fa-pencil-alt fa-fw"></i> Edit types</strong>:
              It sets the <i>"Add"</i> tab on edit mode, allowing the change of properties of existing
              field types. As of the application's current version, only the name can be changed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong><i class="fa fa-plus-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> Add type</strong>:
              It allows the creation of new list, table or section types to choose from when adding
              fields to the form.
            </li>
          </ul>

            Submission forms are automatically backed up every time a change is made, so you can leave
            an incomplete form and come back to it later.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once all the study data has been provided and validated, the form can be submitted by pressing the
            <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm">Submit</button>
            button, located both in the secondary top bar. If the submission has been successful, you will receive
            further instructions on the following page, and the accession number of your submission after it has been
            processed, in an e-mail. .
          </p>

          BioStudies submission tool also allows the automatic extraction of study data from a selected pre-formatted
          file. This study file has to follow the <a
          href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/misc/SubmissionFormatV5a.pdf">PageTab</a> format. PageTab files/folders
          can be submitted by clicking the down-arrow button on the right side of "New Submission" and selecting
          "Submit PageTab".
