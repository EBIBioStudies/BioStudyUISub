                            The first screen shown after login is the list of so-called "Submissions". Each of these is
                            effectively a form for the study data to be added to the BioStudies database.

                           &mdash;as a "pending" submission&mdash; or after &mdash;as "sent" submission&mdash;.
                           Additionally, in the case of a sent submission, any recent changes in the form can be cancelled,

                            its release date. If the form is submitted with any required fields blank, the application
                            will cancel the submission process and highlight the field.

                            side of the form at all times. Clicking on any entry of the checklist sets the focus on the
