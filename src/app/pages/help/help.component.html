                                for uploads. You will need to know your secret directory to be able to upload data
                                into your BioStudies Files area. This can be obtained by clicking on
                                <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm">FTP/Aspera</button> and

                            A given study can be edited at any point of its lifecycle: before being added to the database
                            (as a <i>"Draft"</i> submission) or afterwards (as <i>"Submitted"</i> submission).
                            Additionally, in the case of a sent submission, any recent changes in the form can be cancelled,
                            reverting the form to its previous state before the changes.

                            Submission forms are automatically backed up every time a change is made, so you can leave
                            an incomplete form and come back to it later.

                            Once all the study data has been provided, the form can be submitted by pressing the
                            <button type="button" class="btn-submit btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
                            button, located both in the secondary top bar and at the bottom of the form. If the
                            submission has been successful, a summary of all the information pertaining the study is shown.

                            If the form is submitted with any required fields blank, the application will cancel the
                            submission process and highlight the relevant fields.
