Cells were rehydrated by incubating (5 min, RT) with FISH wash buffer (10 % formamide, 2x SSC).

Coverslips were twice incubated (37\u00b0C, 30 min) in pre-warmed FISH wash buffer, then in PBS containing 0.5 \u03bcg/ml 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (5 min, RT), washed twice with PBS, dipped in water, air-dried, placed cell-coated side down on a drop of ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant (Life Technologies), allowed to polymerize for 24 h in the dark and then sealed with nail varnish.',
                'Immunostained spreads of Arabidopsis pachytene cells were prepared for 3D-SIM imaging as follows. To roughly stage the meiocytes, a single anther from a floral bud was removed and squashed in a drop of water on a clean slide under a coverslip and inspected using brightfield microscopy. Early- and mid-pachytene meiocytes were still stuck together within a meiocyte column, whilst late-pachytene meiocytes had begun to break apart from one-another. More precise staging of early and late pachytene meiocytes was also based on previously defined HEI10 behaviour, with mid pachytene meiocytes exhibiting an intermediate phenotype.
