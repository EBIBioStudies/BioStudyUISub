Cells were rehydrated by incubating (5 min, RT) with FISH wash buffer (10 % formamide, 2x SSC).

                "Immunostained spreads of Arabidopsis pachytene cells were prepared for 3D-SIM imaging as follows. To roughly stage the meiocytes, a single anther from a floral bud was removed and squashed in a drop of water on a clean slide under a coverslip and inspected using brightfield microscopy. Early- and mid-pachytene meiocytes were still stuck together within a meiocyte column, whilst late-pachytene meiocytes had begun to break apart from one-another. More precise staging of early and late pachytene meiocytes was also based on previously defined HEI10 behaviour, with mid pachytene meiocytes exhibiting an intermediate phenotype. The remaining 5 anthers containing meiocytes of the desired stage were dissected from the staged buds. They were then macerated using a brass rod on a No. 1.5H coverslip (Marienfeld) in 10 \u00b5l digestion medium (0.4% cytohelicase, 1.5% sucrose, 1% polyvinylpyrolidone in sterile water) for 1 min. Coverslips were then incubated in a moist chamber at 37 \u00b0C for 4 min before adding 10 \u00b5l of 2% lipsol solution followed by 20 \u00b5l 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 8). Coverslips were dried in the fume hood for 3 h, blocked in 0.3% bovine serum albumin in 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution and then incubated with primary antibody at 4 \u00b0C overnight and secondary antibody at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h. In between antibody incubations, coverslips were washed 3 times for 5 min in 1x PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100.

Imaging fields of view containing identified OPCs were selected to obtain 10-20 SPOTs per mouse. Chronic 2-photon imaging was performed starting 3 days after surgery. All SPOTs were checked on a daily basis and no z-stack was acquired if no changes occurred. The imaging was performed on custom-built 2-photon microscope (Sutter Instrument Movable Objective Microscope type) using a long-working distance objective (water immersion, 16x magnification, 0.8NA, Nikon) and equipped with a ytterbium-doped laser system at 1045nm and 200fs (Femtotrain, High-Q lasers) or a fiber oscillator 45 laser at 1070nm (Fidelity-2, Coherent) to excite tdTomato labeled cells in the CC. Emission light was detected using a photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu) after passing a red emission filter (610/75 nm; AHF).",

Exposure time for the green channel was 55 ms and exposure for the red channel was 70 ms. The line illumination tool was used to improve background levels and was set to 40 pixels.",

The raw data were computationally reconstructed with SoftWoRx 6.5.2 (GE Healthcare) using channel-specific OTFs recorded using immersion oil with RI 1.512, and Wiener filter settings between 0.002-0.006 to generate 3D stacks of 115 nm (488 nm) or 130 nm (593 nm) lateral and approximately 350 nm axial resolution.

The image analysis pipeline contained six main steps: bivalent skeleton tracing, trace fluorescence intensity quantification, HEI10 peak detection, HEI10 foci identification, HEI10 foci intensity quantification, and total bivalent intensity quantification. Note that the normalization steps used for foci identification differ from those used for foci intensity quantification; the former was intended to robustly identify foci from noisy traces, whilst the latter was used to carefully quantify foci HEI10 levels.",

Image quantification was carried out using Fiji (Schindelin et al, 2012). Deconvolved images were compressed to 2D images displaying the maximum intensity projection for each pixel across z-stacks listed in Table S7 (column \u201cProjected\u201d). Cell and nuclear areas were outlined using thresholding functions on the background TRITC signal and DAPI signal, respectively. Dots corresponding to transcripts were then counted for both nuclear and cytoplasmic areas for each image by applying the \u201cFind Maxima\u201d command with a noise tolerance specified in Table S7 (column \u201cMaxima\u201d). Bar charts show the mean number of dots per nuclear area and cytoplasmic area across all images for all combined replicates."
